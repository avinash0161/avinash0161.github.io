I am a Computer Science PhD student in University of California, Irvine, under the supervision of [Prof. Chen Li](https://chenli.ics.uci.edu/). My research is in the field of databases and scalable data processing systems. I work on the [Texera service](https://github.com/Texera/texera) and the [Amber engine](http://www.vldb.org/pvldb/vol13/p740-kumar.pdf) that powers it.

I completed Bachelors and Masters in Computer Science and Engineering from IIT Roorkee in 2015. Thereafter, I worked at Microsoft for two years on Office for Android and the Kaizala product. I joined UCI for my PhD in 2017.
